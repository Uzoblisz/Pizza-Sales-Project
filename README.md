### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;
1. Daily/Monthly Trend for Total Orders
2. Percentage of Sales per Pizza Category/Size
3. Top 5 Best sellers by Total Revenue, Quantity & Order.
4. Bottom 5 Best sellers by Total Revenue, Quantity & Order.

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows;
1. The Classic Pizza category is the best category in terms of sales and revenue.
2. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the month, with a noiticeable peak during the month of July before a drastic drop in sales in the month of October.
3. Fridays have the highest orders on a daily basis.
4. The best selling pizza by total quantity and total order is the Classic Deluxe Pizza where as, the Thai chicken Pizza is the best seller by total revenue.
5. The worst sellers by Total Revenue, Quantity & Order are the Spinach Pesto Pizza, the Soppressata pizza and the Chicken Pesto Pizza respectively.

### Recommendations

- Investigate October Sales Drop: Analyze the factors contributing to the drastic drop in sales in October as seasonality, external events, or marketing initiatives during that period may be a contributing factor. Understanding the cause will help in developing strategies to mitigate such drops in the future.
- Optimize Friday Operations: Given that Fridays have the highest orders, there may be a need to optimize staffing and resources to meet the increased demand on Fridays. Consider promotions or special deals on Fridays to capitalize on the peak ordering day.
- Promote Classic Deluxe and Thai Chicken Pizzas: Since the Classic Deluxe Pizza is the best seller by total quantity and total order, and the Thai Chicken Pizza leads in total revenue, focus on promoting these pizzas through special offers or marketing strategies to maximize their sales potential.
- Review and Adjust Pricing Strategy: Evaluate the pricing strategy for the Spinach Pesto Pizza, Soppressata Pizza, and Chicken Pesto Pizza, which are identified as the worst sellers by total revenue, quantity, and order. Consider adjusting prices, running promotions, or even repositioning these items on the menu to improve their performance.
- Explore Seasonal Variations: Given the noticeable peak in sales during July, consider exploring the reasons behind this increase. If it's related to seasonal trends or events, develop targeted seasonal promotions or menu additions to capitalize on similar patterns in the future.
- Collect and analyze customer feedback to understand preferences and areas for improvement. Engage with customers through surveys or social media to gather insights that can inform product development and marketing strategies.
